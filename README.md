# Live-Face-Detection-App-with-Total-Face-Count

1. Face Detection and Count using OpenCV:-
This project performs real-time face detection and counting using a webcam feed. It utilizes OpenCVâ€™s Haarcascade classifier to identify human faces and displays the total number of faces detected in each frame.

2. Features-
Real-time face detection from live webcam input

Displays total face count on the screen

Uses Haarcascade XML classifier for accurate detection

Lightweight, fast, and easy to run on most systems

Beginner-friendly and easy to understand


ðŸ› 3. Requirements-
Python 3.x

OpenCV (opencv-python) library

Webcam (built-in or external)

Haarcascade XML file for frontal face detection

4. How to Run-
Clone or download this repository.

Make sure the required packages are installed.

Connect a webcam to your computer.

Run the Python script.

The webcam window will open and start detecting faces.

The number of faces will be displayed in real-time on the screen.

Press Esc key to stop the program.
